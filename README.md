## How it Works
Reddit Sentiment Polarity uses the `PRAW` (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library to retrieve posts from Reddit based on the user-specified topic and keywords. The application then uses the `TextBlob` library to perform sentiment analysis on the posts.

The sentiment analysis process involves several steps:

1. Text Preprocessing: The raw text of the posts is cleaned and preprocessed by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters.

2. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Each word in the text is tagged with its part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

3. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each sentence in the text is determined by analyzing the words and their POS tags. The sentiment of the entire text is then calculated based on the sentiment of the individual sentences.

4. Polarity Score: A polarity score is assigned to the text based on its sentiment. The polarity score ranges from -1 (negative sentiment) to 1 (positive sentiment).
